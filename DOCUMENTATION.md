# ðŸ“– Event Scheduler System Documentation

## Overview
The Event Scheduler System is a modern, minimalist, and user-friendly application built with Python and Flask. It allows users to efficiently manage their events, appointments, meetings, and tasks. The system supports event creation, listing, updating, deletion, reminders, recurring events, search, and email notifications. It is designed for extensibility and ease of use, with both a RESTful API and a beautiful web interface.

## Testing

- Run all tests:
  ```bash
  pytest test_app.py -v
  ```
- (Optional) Run with coverage:
  ```bash
  pytest test_app.py --cov=app -v
  ```

---

## Postman Collection
- Import `Event_Scheduler_API.postman_collection.json` into Postman to test all API endpoints easily.

---

## Email Notifications (Optional)
- To enable email notifications, update the `EMAIL_CONFIG` in `app.py` with your SMTP server, email, and app password.
- Uncomment the line `self.send_email_notification(event)` in the `check_reminders` method.
- For Gmail, enable 2FA and use an App Password.

---

## Customization & Extensibility
- The code is modular and easy to extend for new features (e.g., user authentication, calendar integration, advanced recurrence, etc.).
- UI can be customized via `templates/index.html`.
- API can be extended by adding new routes in `app.py`.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Port already in use:** Change the port in `app.py` or stop the process using port 5000.
- **Email not working:** Check SMTP settings and credentials.
- **Import errors:** Reinstall dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`.
